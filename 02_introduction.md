##Abstract
Based on the set of resource-conscious use cases and services provided by IoT devices, the development of operating systems suited to constrained systems is on the rise; many of which thrive as open-source community driven projects. As security researchers, this affords us a unique opportunity to improve IoT stability at the heart of the issue, by working alongside developers to improve the robustness of their systems. Current open-source projects such as Contiki, TinyOS and RIOT feature open, publicly accessible repositories, allowing for the complete project source files to be scrutinised, and evaluated by the community. As such, obscuring weak security features is no longer feasible, and so the overall robustness of the system can improve beyond that of a proprietary system based on this exposure. Through this method, security techniques such as static analysis and reverse engineering can be applied to the source code and prevent vulnerabilities before they are released into the wild. This project intends to explore the effectiveness of static analysis tools on performing security analyses on the codebases of IoT systems, focusing on Contiki OS. 

##Aim
This corpus intends to provide supplementary material and evidence to support the project dissertation. Stored within are materials documenting the results of the project, as well as a record of the developmental process leading to them. This corpus provides a roadmap of the areas of the project, whereas several heavily detailed aspects will be further described within the body of the dissertation itself.
