RIOT/boards/msba2-common/tools/src/download.c:415:  [4] (format) snprintf:

  It's often easy to fool getlogin. Sometimes it does not work at all,
  because some program messed up the utmp file. Often, it gives only the
  first 8 characters of the login name. The user currently logged in on the
  controlling tty of our program need not be the user who started it. Avoid
  getlogin() for security-related purposes (CWE-807). Use getpwuid(geteuid())
  and extract the desired information instead.
