  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.

  easily misused). Risk is low because the source is a constant string.

  around to create a race condition, control its ancestors, or change its
  contents? (CWE-362).

  consider saving to an unsigned value if that is intended).
