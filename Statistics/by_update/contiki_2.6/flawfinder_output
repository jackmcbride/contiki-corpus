FINAL RESULTS:

contiki-2.6/examples/wget/wget.c:159:  [5] (buffer) gets:
  Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20). Use fgets() instead.
contiki-2.6/examples/wget/wget.c:161:  [5] (buffer) gets:
  Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20). Use fgets() instead.
contiki-2.6/apps/about/about.c:82:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned]
  (CWE-120). Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy
  easily misused).
contiki-2.6/apps/antelope/antelope.c:45:  [4] (format) printf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited
  (CWE-134). Use a constant for the format specification.
