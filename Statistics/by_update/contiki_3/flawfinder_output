FINAL RESULTS:

contiki-3.0/core/net/ip/resolv.c:1094:  [5] (buffer) strncat:
  Easily used incorrectly (e.g., incorrectly computing the correct maximum
  size to add) [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Consider strcat_s, strlcat, snprintf,
  or automatically resizing strings. Risk is high; the length parameter
  appears to be a constant, instead of computing the number of characters
  left.

contiki-3.0/tools/stm32w/tapslip6.c:486:  [1] (obsolete) usleep:
  This C routine is considered obsolete (as opposed to the shell command by
